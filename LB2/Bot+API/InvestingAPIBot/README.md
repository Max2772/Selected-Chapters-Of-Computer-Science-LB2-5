[@InvestingAPIBot](https://t.me/InvestingAPIBot) is a Telegram bot built with `aiogram` that allows you to manage and track your investment portfolio 📊 in real-time. It integrates with [InvestAPI](https://github.com/Max2772/InvestAPI) to fetch prices for stocks, ETFs, cryptocurrencies, and Steam items. The bot consolidates data from multiple asset types into one convenient interface, eliminating the need to check prices across multiple apps or websites.

**Key Features:**
- 📈 Track stocks, crypto, and Steam items in a single portfolio.
- 🔔 Set price alerts.
- 📜 View full purchase/removal history.
- 💻 Reliable cached prices from [InvestAPI](https://github.com/Max2772/InvestAPI).
- 🚀 Docker-based production setup with PostgreSQL.

The bot is live and public: [@InvestingAPIBot](https://t.me/InvestingAPIBot).  
Development uses SQLite; production uses PostgreSQL (via Docker).


## Installation 🛠️

### Requirements
- Python 3.11 (recommended)
- Running [InvestAPI](https://github.com/Max2772/InvestAPI) (default: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`/`http://investapi:8000`)
- Docker + docker-compose (for production PostgreSQL)
- Telegram Bot Token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)


### Local Development
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Max2772/InvestingAPIBot.git
   cd InvestingAPIBot
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements/dev/requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create `.env` in the project root:
   ```env
   LOG_LEVEL=INFO
   BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
   API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
   DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///InvestingAPIBot.db
   ASYNC_DATABASE_URL=sqlite+aiosqlite:///InvestingAPIBot.db
   MAXIMUM_ALERTS=10
   ALERT_INTERVAL_SECONDS=300
   ```

4. Run the bot:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Production (Docker)

1. Make sure [InvestAPI](https://github.com/Max2772/InvestAPI) is running and accessible via `API_BASE_URL`.

2. Create a `.env` file in the project root and update the PostgreSQL connection settings:
   ```env
   LOG_LEVEL=INFO
   BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
   API_BASE_URL=http://investapi:8000
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://devserver:your_password@database:5432/investingapibot
   ASYNC_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://devserver:your_password@database:5432/investingapibot
   MAXIMUM_ALERTS=10
   ALERT_INTERVAL_SECONDS=300

**Notes:**

* Use `API_BASE_URL=http://investapi:8000` instead of `localhost` so the bot can reach the API inside Docker.
* `database` is the service name of PostgreSQL in your `docker-compose.yml`.
* Make sure to set a secure password for your database.

3. For production (PostgreSQL) you should create a separate `database.env` file inside the `/docker` folder with the following fields:

   ```env
   POSTGRES_USER=your_user
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_password
   POSTGRES_DB=investingapibot
   ```

   This file will be used by the PostgreSQL container during startup.

4. Start the stack:

   ```bash
   docker compose up --build -d
   ```

   The bot will be available in Telegram.

## Usage 📝

Interact with the bot directly in Telegram at [@InvestingAPIBot](https://t.me/InvestingAPIBot).  

Start with `/start` to open the main menu (with quick portfolio overview via buttons) or `/help` to see the full list of commands.

All commands now use a unified format with `asset_type` (`stock`, `crypto`, or `steam`). For Steam items, include `app_id` (e.g., `730` for CS2).

### Key Commands

- **/check** `<asset_type>` [`<app_id>`] `<asset_name>`  
  Get the current price of any asset.  
  Examples:  
  ```
  /check stock AMD
  /check crypto BTC
  /check steam 730 Glove Case
  ```
  Sample responses:  
  ```
  Stock AMD: $202.05
  ```
  ```
  Crypto BTC: $73359.0
  ```
  ```
  Steam Glove Case: $20.85
  ```

- **/add** `<asset_type>` [`<app_id>`] `<asset_name>` `<quantity>` [-p `<price>`]  
  Add an asset to your portfolio. Use optional `-p <price>` to set your custom purchase price (otherwise uses current market price).  
  Examples:  
  ```
  /add stock AMD 2 -p 170.50
  /add crypto SOLANA 15
  /add steam 730 Glove Case 10 -p 2.15
  /add crypto BTC 0.05 -p 76969.69
  /add steam 730 Operation Bravo Case 10
  ```
  Sample responses:  
  ```
  Added 2 AMD at 170.50$
  ```
  ```
  Added 15 SOLANA at 92.35$
  ```
  ```
  Added 10 Glove Case at 2.15$
  ```

- **/remove** `<asset_type>` [`<app_id>`] `<asset_name>` [`<quantity>`]  
  Remove an asset (or a specific quantity) from your portfolio. If no quantity is given, removes all.  
  Examples:  
  ```
  /remove stock AMD 2
  /remove crypto BTC
  /remove steam 730 Glove Case 10
  ```
  Sample responses:  
  ```
  Removed 2 AMD from portfolio.
  ```
  ```
  Removed BTC from portfolio.
  ```
  ```
  Removed 10 Glove Case from portfolio.
  ```

- **/portfolio** [`all|stock|crypto|steam`]  
  View your portfolio (filtered by type or all). Shows quantity, average buy price, current price, value, and profit/loss % per asset, plus total value and overall growth.  
  Example:  
  ```
  /portfolio all
  ```
  Sample response:
  ```

- **/set_alert** `<asset_type>` [`<app_id>`] `<asset_name>` `<condition>` `<price>`  
  Set a price alert (conditions: `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`). Alerts trigger notifications when met.  
  Example:  
  ```
  /set_alert stock AMD > 200
  ```
  Sample response:  
  ```
  🔔 Alert created for AMD (stock) with target > $200.00.
  ```

- **/alerts**  
  List all your active alerts with IDs.  
  Sample response:  
  ```
  📢 Your Alerts
  #3: BTC, target >= $100000.00

  #6: AMD, target > $200.00
  ```

- **/delete_alert** `<id>`  
  Delete an alert by its ID (from `/alerts`).  
  Example: `/delete_alert 6`


- When an alert triggers, you'll get a notification like:
  ```
  🔔 Alert Triggered!

  Current price: $202.05
  Target: > $200.00
  ```

- **/history** [`all|stock|crypto|steam`]  
  View the full log of additions and removals.

### Example Portfolio (/portfolio all)
<img src="assets/bot_example.png" alt="Portfolio Command Example" width="600"/>

Shows quantity, average buy price, current price, value, profit/loss %, total portfolio value and growth.

## Limitations
- Maximum 10 alerts per user (`MAXIMUM_ALERTS`).
- Alerts checked every 300 seconds (`ALERT_INTERVAL_SECONDS`).
- No hard limit on portfolio size (high-precision `Numeric` type in DB).

## Dependencies & Architecture 🏗️

### Production Dependencies
- `python-dotenv`
- `aiogram`
- `sqlalchemy`
- `psycopg2-binary`
- `asyncpg`

(Development adds `aiosqlite` instead of psycopg2/asyncpg.)

### Architecture
The bot uses `aiogram` for async Telegram handling. It fetches prices from InvestAPI and stores user data in the database:
- `users` — registered users
- `portfolios` — assets, quantities, buy prices
- `alerts` — price alerts
- `history` — all additions/removals
